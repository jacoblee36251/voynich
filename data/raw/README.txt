The files in this directory, and the subdirectory /beta , are 
related to a general reformating of transliteration files of the 
Voynich MS text.

A new format, called IVTFF (Intermediate Voynich Transliteration
File Format) has been defined, such that it can represent all
existing and publicly available transliteration files in their own 
representation alphabet, in a consistent manner.

For general information see:
http://www.voynich.nu/transcr.html

For more specific information see:
http://www.voynich.nu/extra/transcr_new.html

Reasonably stable files are in the present directory.
Files that are still subject to change, and are being beta-tested,
may be found in subdirectory /beta , which also has its own
README file.

Two tool called 'bitrans' and 'ivtt' are able to read and process all 
files in this format. For these tools see:

ZL_ivtff_1r.txt
---------------
The latest release of the Zandbergen-Landini transcription of 1999 
in the IVTFF 1.7 format. 
This file is compatible with format version 1.6 and does not yet use the
extensions of format version 1.7.
It is a complete transcription, including all 5389 loci that have 
been identified in the MS. It uses the Eva alphabet, including the 
high-ascii extensions.
The file has been corrected in numerous places.
Some parts of the text inside folds of the pages still need to be
added.
